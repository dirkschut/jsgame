            <p><b>11-Sep-2017</b> Today is a glorius day in the world of JSGame, for the world has expanded! Indeed, it has gone from 200 tiles to 600 tiles. This massive increase is due to the scrolling of maps which I haev implemented which allows for bigger maps. Currently the biggest map is 20 by 20 tiles, though it's still mostly empty.</p>
            <p>Next on the agenda is some very basic interaction with the world to get something like iron ore and another interaction to turn it into iron bars. This will probably require a couple of entities, but I'll cope.</p>
            <p>That's it. Ta.</p>

        <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
        <p><b>10-Sep-2017</b> Hello, world! This is the first news update for this game thingy that I'm putting together because I have to keep my programming skills sharp. I'm not intending to show this thing to too many people but just keep it for myself. I'm also not planning to do too much with it except work on it every now and then to keep programming.</p>
        <p>That said, if you have somehow found this page and you have any suggestion you are welcome to send them to me. The github issue system is great for that. Also, feel free to fork this repo and do what you want with it. Just no earning money of it or getting donations because of it. And if you do fork it give me sufficient credit and let me use the stuff you do with it without limits for free.</p>
        <p>That's it. Ta.</p>
